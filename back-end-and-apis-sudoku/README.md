# Sudoku

Project based on: https://github.com/lorenzo-lipp/Free-Code-Camp-Projects/tree/main/quality-assurance-sudoku-solver

It implements an API that allows you to generate new sudoku games and to get sudoku solutions.

It also allows you to play with a React interface that fetches the API to get a new game every refresh.
